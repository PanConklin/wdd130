        Long story short, the name Brett sounds like Bread, so my friends have
        called me Bread since middle school!

        I am from Washington DC, I like to play guitar, work on my truck and
        other cars! My biggest hobbie has got to be snowboarding! I started
        snowboarding last season and I probable got in 45-50 days on the mtn!
        The thing I love the most about BYU-Idaho is how easy it is to make
        friends here as long as you are willing to put in some effort! I think
        one of the most advantageous part of learning web design is being able
        to effectivly understand client/server architecture and how you are able
        to use front-end languages to manipulate the interface. I'm excited to
        learn with you all!
